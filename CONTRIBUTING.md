uv run pre-commit install
```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_models.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Run linters
make lint

# Or run individually with uv
uv run black src/ tests/ examples/
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ examples/
uv run mypy src/
```

### Testing Changes Locally

```bash
# Start Langfuse
make docker-up

# Run agent demo
make agent

# Run evaluations
make eval

# Interactive testing
make interactive
```
