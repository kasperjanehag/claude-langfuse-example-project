  "objectives": [
    {
      "objective_id": "OBJ-TRANS-1",
      "objective_name": "Transparency in data processing",
      "description": "Ensure all personal data processing activities are clearly communicated to data subjects through systematic notice management and disclosure mechanisms that provide comprehensive, accessible, and timely information about processing operations",
      "domain": "Data protection",
      "intent": "Enable data subjects to understand how their personal data is collected, used, stored, and shared by providing clear, accessible transparency mechanisms",
      "linked_obligation_ids": ["OBL-GDPR-2"],
      "rationale": "Transparency is a fundamental principle requiring systematic communication mechanisms. Data subjects must be informed about processing activities through well-designed privacy notices, disclosures, and communication channels that are appropriate for their level of understanding and context."
    },
    {
      "objective_id": "OBJ-PURPOSE-1",
      "objective_name": "Purpose limitation and specification",
      "description": "Establish and enforce controls to ensure personal data is collected and processed only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes that are determined and documented before data collection begins, and that subsequent processing remains compatible with those original purposes",
      "domain": "Data protection",
      "intent": "Prevent scope creep and unauthorized secondary use of personal data by establishing clear purpose boundaries and compatibility assessment procedures",
      "linked_obligation_ids": ["OBL-GDPR-3", "OBL-GDPR-4"],
      "rationale": "Purpose limitation is a core data protection principle that prevents data controllers from repurposing data beyond the original scope. This requires both upfront specification (collecting for defined purposes) and ongoing enforcement (preventing incompatible processing). Both obligations work together to establish comprehensive purpose limitation controls."
    },
    {
      "objective_id": "OBJ-DATAMIN-1",
      "objective_name": "Data minimization and adequacy",
      "description": "Implement systematic procedures to ensure that personal data collection and processing is limited to what is adequate, relevant, and strictly necessary for the specified purposes, through necessity assessments, data inventory reviews, and retention scheduling aligned with purpose requirements",
      "domain": "Data protection",
      "intent": "Minimize privacy risk and regulatory exposure by collecting and retaining only the minimum personal data necessary to accomplish stated purposes",
      "linked_obligation_ids": ["OBL-GDPR-5"],
      "rationale": "Data minimization reduces both privacy risk to individuals and operational risk to the organization by limiting the volume and scope of personal data holdings. This requires upfront necessity assessments before collection and ongoing reviews to identify and eliminate unnecessary data."
    },
    {
      "objective_id": "OBJ-FAIR-1",
      "objective_name": "Fairness in personal data processing",
      "description": "Establish procedures to assess and ensure that all personal data processing is conducted fairly toward data subjects, including impact assessments, safeguards against discriminatory outcomes, and mechanisms for addressing data subject concerns and complaints",
      "domain": "Data protection",
      "intent": "Ensure processing operations do not create unfair, discriminatory, or unexpected outcomes for data subjects by systematically evaluating impacts and implementing appropriate safeguards",
      "linked_obligation_ids": ["OBL-GDPR-1"],
      "rationale": "Fairness is a fundamental processing principle that goes beyond legal compliance to encompass ethical treatment of data subjects. This requires proactive impact assessment, safeguards against adverse outcomes, and responsive mechanisms for addressing concernsâ€”all evaluated from the data subject's perspective before processing begins."
