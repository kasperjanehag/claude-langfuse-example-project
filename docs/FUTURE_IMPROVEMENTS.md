# Future Improvements - Controls Generation System

This document outlines planned enhancements for the controls generation system beyond Phase 1.

## Phase 1 Status (Current Implementation)

✅ **Completed:**
- Pydantic models for Obligation, Control, and CompanyContext
- Deterministic rule-based control generation
- Excel-based obligation loading
- Langfuse tracing integration
- JSON output for generated controls
- Basic template-based control descriptions
- Mock company context for demo purposes

❌ **Not Included in Phase 1:**
- LLM-based control generation
- Evaluation metrics
- Langfuse dataset integration
- Framework mappings (SCF, ISO27001, SOC2)
- Real company context integration
- Control optimization and refinement
- Gap analysis against existing controls

---

## Phase 2: LLM-Based Control Generation

### Overview
Replace deterministic templates with LLM-based generation for more sophisticated and context-aware controls.

### Planned Features

#### 1. Structured LLM Generation
- Use OpenAI's function calling or structured outputs
- Generate controls with richer descriptions based on:
  - Obligation requirements
  - Company context (size, industry, systems)
  - Existing controls (for consistency)
  - Best practices database

#### 2. Multi-Step Generation Process
```
1. Analyze obligation(s) → Extract key requirements
2. Check existing controls → Identify gaps
3. Generate control draft → Using LLM with context
4. Refine control → Add evidence requirements
5. Validate control → Check completeness and actionability
```

#### 3. Context-Aware Customization
- Tailor controls to company size (SME vs enterprise)
- Consider technical capabilities (available systems)
- Adjust language and complexity for compliance maturity level
- Reference specific tools/systems in control descriptions

#### 4. Implementation Approach
```python
class AdvancedControlGenerator:
    @observe(name="generate_control_with_llm")
    def generate_control_with_llm(
        self,
        obligations: List[Obligation],
        company_context: CompanyContext,
        existing_controls: List[Control],
    ) -> Control:
        """Generate control using LLM with full context."""

        # Build rich prompt with:
        # - Obligation details and legal text
        # - Company profile and systems
        # - Existing controls for consistency
        # - Evidence requirements examples

        # Use structured output to ensure completeness
        # Validate generated control meets all requirements
```

---

## Phase 3: Evaluation Metrics

### Overview
Implement binary pass/fail evaluation metrics to validate generated controls.

### Planned Metrics

#### 1. Completeness Metric
**Purpose:** Verify control has all required fields populated

**Checks:**
- ✅ Control ID is valid format
- ✅ Control name is descriptive and unique
- ✅ Description is detailed (minimum length, specific actions)
- ✅ Linked obligations are valid IDs
- ✅ Evidence requirements are specified
- ✅ Rationale explains how obligation is satisfied
- ✅ Timing and triggers are defined
- ✅ Review interval is appropriate for impact level

**Implementation:**
```python
class CompletenessMetric(BaseMetric):
    async def evaluate(
        self, control: Control, ground_truth: Optional[Control] = None
    ) -> Tuple[float, str, bool]:
        """Check if control has all required fields."""
        checks = {
            "has_description": len(control.control_description) >= 100,
            "has_evidence": control.expected_evidence is not None,
            "has_rationale": control.rationale is not None,
            "has_timing": control.timing_type is not None,
            # ... more checks
        }

        passed = all(checks.values())
        score = sum(checks.values()) / len(checks)

        return score, explanation, passed
```

#### 2. Coverage Metric
**Purpose:** Verify control adequately addresses all linked obligations

**Checks:**
- ✅ Control description references key requirements from each obligation
- ✅ Evidence requirements align with obligation verification needs
- ✅ Timing matches obligation deadlines
- ✅ No obligations are partially addressed

**Implementation:**
```python
class CoverageMetric(BaseMetric):
    async def evaluate(
        self,
        control: Control,
        obligations: List[Obligation],
        ground_truth: Optional[Control] = None,
    ) -> Tuple[float, str, bool]:
        """Check if control covers all obligations."""
        # For each linked obligation:
        # - Verify key terms appear in description
        # - Check timing requirements are met
        # - Validate evidence can prove compliance
```

#### 3. Actionability Metric
**Purpose:** Verify control is specific and implementable

**Checks:**
- ✅ Uses concrete, specific language (not vague)
- ✅ Includes measurable criteria or outputs
- ✅ Specifies responsible parties or systems
- ✅ Provides step-by-step procedures
- ✅ References specific tools/systems when appropriate

**Implementation:**
```python
class ActionabilityMetric(BaseMetric):
    async def evaluate(
        self, control: Control, company_context: CompanyContext
    ) -> Tuple[float, str, bool]:
        """Check if control is actionable and specific."""
        # Check for vague language: "as needed", "appropriate", "reasonable"
        # Check for specific systems mentioned
        # Check for measurable outputs
        # Optionally use LLM to assess clarity
```

#### 4. Evidence Clarity Metric
**Purpose:** Verify evidence requirements are clear and measurable

**Checks:**
- ✅ Evidence items are specific artifacts
- ✅ Evidence can be collected/audited
- ✅ Evidence format is specified (documents, screenshots, logs)
- ✅ Evidence sufficiently proves control operation

## Phase 4: Dataset & Evaluation Runs

### Overview
Create Langfuse datasets from test obligations and run systematic evaluations.

### Planned Features

#### 1. Dataset Creation
```python
# Create dataset from obligations Excel
dataset_manager = LangfuseDatasetManager()
dataset_manager.create_dataset_from_obligations(
    dataset_name="gdpr_obligations_v1",
    excel_path="data/obligations/Obligations and Controls example.xlsx",
    ground_truth_controls="data/obligations/ground_truth_controls.json"
)
```

#### 2. Evaluation Runs
```python
# Run systematic evaluation
results = []
for obligation_set in dataset:
    generated_control = agent.generate_control(obligation_set, company_context)

    # Evaluate with all metrics
    for metric in [CompletenessMetric(), CoverageMetric(), ActionabilityMetric()]:
        score, explanation, passed = await metric.evaluate(
            generated_control,
            obligations=obligation_set,
            ground_truth=ground_truth_control
        )
        # Log to Langfuse
```

## Contributing

When implementing these improvements:

1. **Start with tests**: Write evaluation criteria before implementation
2. **Use Langfuse**: Trace all new functionality for observability
3. **Document decisions**: Update this file with rationale and outcomes
4. **Iterate based on data**: Use traces and metrics to guide improvements
5. **Keep it simple**: Add complexity only when justified by real needs
