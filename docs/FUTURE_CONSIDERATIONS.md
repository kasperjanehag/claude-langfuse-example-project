# Future Considerations for Control Generation System

This document captures design considerations and potential enhancements for future iterations of the control generation system.

## Version 1 Scope

The current implementation focuses on getting the core two-stage LLM-driven system working:
- Stage 1: Obligations → Control Objectives (LLM-driven matching or generation)
- Stage 2: Objectives + Context → Control Variants (LLM-driven matching or generation)
- No confidence scoring - LLM makes all decisions
- No human approval workflows - auto-add all LLM-generated objectives and variants
- No consolidation - registries grow organically

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Confidence Scoring and Thresholding

**Current State**: LLM makes binary decisions (match or generate new) without confidence scores.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Add confidence scores to all LLM decisions (0.0-1.0)
- Implement thresholds:
  - High confidence (>0.9): Auto-approve
  - Medium confidence (0.7-0.9): Flag for review
  - Low confidence (<0.7): Require human approval
- Track confidence metrics over time to calibrate thresholds

**Use Cases**:
- Prevent low-quality objective generation
- Enable human oversight for ambiguous cases
- Build confidence in the system over time

**Implementation Notes**:
- Update LLM prompts to include confidence field
- Create review queue mechanism
- Add confidence tracking to Langfuse traces

### 2. Registry Consolidation and Deduplication

**Current State**: Registries grow organically without consolidation. Similar objectives may be created separately.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Periodic consolidation job to identify similar objectives
- Use embeddings + LLM to detect semantic duplicates
- Propose merges with impact analysis (which obligations/variants affected)
- Human-approved merge operations

**Use Cases**:
- Keep registry lean and manageable
- Improve matching accuracy (fewer near-duplicates)
- Maintain high-quality semantic layer

**Implementation Notes**:
- Embedding-based similarity search (cosine similarity >0.95)
- LLM-based semantic equivalence check
- Create merge preview showing affected mappings
- Implement merge operation with ID remapping

---

### 3. Historical Consistency Validation

**Current State**: Temperature=0 provides deterministic outputs, but model updates could change behavior.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Store historical mappings (obligation text → objective IDs)
- When LLM model updates occur:
  - Re-analyze sample of historical obligations
  - Compare new mappings to historical mappings
  - Flag significant deviations for review
- Decision framework:
  - Option A: Always use cached mappings (absolute consistency)
  - Option B: Allow model improvements (better accuracy)
  - Option C: Hybrid - cache for X months, then re-analyze

**Use Cases**:
- Ensure compliance program stability
- Detect when model updates improve/degrade mapping quality
- Audit trail for compliance validation

**Implementation Notes**:
- Store mapping history in separate table/file
- Create consistency report comparing old vs new mappings
- Implement configurable consistency policy

---

### 4. Embedding-Based Similarity Matching

**Current State**: LLM performs matching through text analysis in prompt context.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Pre-compute embeddings for all objectives and variants
- Use vector similarity search as first-pass filter
- LLM only evaluates top-K most similar candidates
- Benefits:
  - Faster matching (especially as registries grow)
  - Better handling of paraphrased obligations
  - Reduced LLM token costs

**Use Cases**:
- Scale to thousands of objectives
- Improve matching for similar but differently-worded obligations
- Speed up the matching process

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use Anthropic's upcoming embedding API or OpenAI embeddings
- Implement vector database (ChromaDB, Pinecone, or simple numpy)
- Hybrid approach: vector search (fast) + LLM validation (accurate)

---

### 5. Human Review Workflows

**Current State**: All LLM decisions are auto-approved.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Review queue for low-confidence decisions
- Approval workflow with role-based access
- Feedback loop: human corrections inform LLM
- Review metrics:
  - Approval rate
  - Edit rate (approved with changes)
  - Rejection rate

**Use Cases**:
- Quality control for sensitive compliance programs
- Training data collection for fine-tuning
- Compliance officer oversight

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create review UI or API
- Store review decisions as training examples
- Implement feedback loop into prompts (few-shot examples)

---

### 6. Registry Versioning and Rollback

**Current State**: Registries are single JSON files without version control.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Version each registry change (git-like commits)
- Track who/what made each change (LLM vs human)
- Enable rollback to previous registry state
- Diff visualization between versions

**Use Cases**:
- Audit trail for compliance
- Undo bad LLM generations
- Compare registry evolution over time

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use git for automatic versioning, or
- Implement custom versioning in JSON (append-only log)
- Create diff viewer for registry changes

---

### 7. Multi-Framework Objective Library

**Current State**: System works with any framework, but objectives are mixed together.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Organize objectives by framework/jurisdiction
- Track which frameworks each objective applies to
- Enable framework-specific objective sets
- Support framework-to-framework mapping

**Use Cases**:
- "Show me GDPR-specific objectives"
- "Map CCPA obligations to GDPR objectives"
- Framework compliance reporting

**Implementation Notes**:
- Add `applicable_frameworks: List[str]` to ControlObjective
- Create framework taxonomy
- LLM prompt includes framework context

---

### 8. Evaluation and Quality Metrics

**Current State**: No automated quality evaluation of mappings.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Evaluation dataset with ground truth mappings
- Metrics:
  - Mapping accuracy (precision/recall)
  - Registry growth rate
  - Duplication rate
  - Human override rate
- Continuous evaluation on test set
- Regression detection when model changes

**Use Cases**:
- Validate LLM mapping quality
- Detect when system degrades
- A/B test different prompts or models

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create ground truth dataset (expert-labeled)
- Implement evaluation harness
- Track metrics in Langfuse or separate dashboard

---

### 9. Incremental Learning from Feedback

**Current State**: LLM uses static prompts without learning from corrections.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Collect human corrections as training data
- Use corrections as few-shot examples in prompts
- Periodically update prompt with best examples
- Optional: Fine-tune model on correction data

**Use Cases**:
- System improves over time from corrections
- Capture domain-specific matching patterns
- Reduce need for human review

**Implementation Notes**:
- Store corrections in structured format
- Implement example selection strategy (most recent, most representative)
- Update prompts monthly with new examples

---

### 10. Performance Optimization

**Current State**: Sequential LLM calls for each obligation/objective.

**Future Enhancement**:
- Batch processing: analyze multiple obligations in one LLM call
- Parallel processing: multiple LLM calls concurrently
- Caching: store results for identical obligation text
- Optimize prompts for token efficiency

**Use Cases**:
- Process large obligation sets (100+)
- Reduce latency and costs
- Enable real-time compliance checking

**Implementation Notes**:
- Claude supports batching in single request
- Use asyncio for parallel API calls
- Implement LRU cache for obligation → objectives mapping
- Monitor token usage and optimize prompts

## Model Evolution Strategy

As LLMs improve, the system should leverage new capabilities:

1. **Better structured outputs**: Use native JSON mode when available
2. **Longer context windows**: Include more examples and registry entries
3. **Multi-modal models**: Analyze visual compliance artifacts
4. **Reasoning models**: Deeper analysis of complex obligations
5. **Specialized models**: Fine-tuned compliance models

---

## Data Privacy and Security

Future considerations for sensitive compliance data:

1. **Local LLM deployment**: Option to run models on-premise
2. **Data anonymization**: Scrub company-specific details
3. **Audit logging**: Track all LLM interactions
4. **Access controls**: Role-based registry editing
5. **Encryption**: Encrypt registry data at rest

---

## Scalability Targets

Current system: ~10 objectives, ~10 variants, ~5 obligations
Future targets:
- 1,000+ objectives across all domains
- 5,000+ variants covering all contexts
- Process 1,000+ obligations in <5 minutes
- Support 100+ frameworks/jurisdictions
- 10,000+ companies using shared registry

---

## Research Questions

Open questions for exploration:

1. How do we measure "quality" of generated objectives?
2. What's the optimal granularity for objectives (very specific vs very general)?
3. Should objectives be hierarchical (parent/child relationships)?
4. How do we handle conflicting requirements across jurisdictions?
5. Can we predict which new obligations will require new objectives vs matching existing?
6. What's the theoretical limit to registry size before matching breaks down?

## Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility when implementing enhancements
- Document all design decisions and trade-offs
- Prioritize based on user feedback and pain points
- Keep v1 simple - complexity can come later
